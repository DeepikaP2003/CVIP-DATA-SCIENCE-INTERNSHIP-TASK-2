#Global Terrorism Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project performed on the Global Terrorism dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to gain insights and understanding about global terrorism trends using data visualization and analysis techniques.

##Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd) available on Kaggle. The GTD is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through present.

#Project Overview

- **Data Exploration**: The dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and features.

- **Data Cleaning**: Data quality issues such as missing values and inconsistent formatting are addressed.

- **Feature Analysis**: Different features of the dataset, such as attack types, target types, regions, and attack trends, are explored.

- **Data Visualization**: Various plots and visualizations are created to represent patterns and trends in the data.

##Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Results

The EDA performed on the Global Terrorism dataset provides insights into global terrorism trends, attack patterns, and geographical distribution. 
The analysis aims to contribute to a better understanding of the factors contributing to terrorism incidents.
